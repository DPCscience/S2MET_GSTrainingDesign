    predigree, family, and notes for all barley lines used in this
    study.
2.  `trial_metadata.csv` - information on the experimental trials used
    in this study.

## Data from T3

### Genomewide marker data

The genomewide marker data used in this study are available from T3 and
(in a more readily usable form) from the Data Repository for the
University of Minnesota using the following persistent link:
