S2MET
=====

Description
-----------

Project repository for the spring two-row (**S2**) barley multi-environment trial (**MET**) project. This project will look at the impact of genotype-by-environment interaction when performing genomewide prediction. The project includes a panel of 183 training population lines, 50 validation population lines, and 9 repeated checks.

### Objectives

The objectives of the project are to:

1.  Build a nationwide infrastructure for genomewide selection of two-row spring barley for new environments or growing regions
2.  Test the use of environmental covariables for genomwide selection and for environmental clustering
3.  Develop an `R` package for widespread use among breeders, including those outside of barley

Methods and Materials
---------------------

Trials in the `S2MET` will be performed in 21 environments over 3 years for a total of 43 environments. Below is a map of the location across North America.
