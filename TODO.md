## S2MET To-Do

### Questions

1. What is the impact on prediction accuracy of different methods of measuring the relationship between environments or clustering environments?
    + Genetic correlation
    + Factor analysis / PCA
    + Environmental covariables
2. How is the accuracy of predicting a new environment impacted by the choice of training environments?
    + Can environmental covariables be used to identify mega-environments with reduced GEI within?
    + Are environments that are more distantly related to the target environment less useful in prediction?
3. Compared to methods that use genetic correlation, what is the impact on prediction accuracy of sampling environmental covariables or clustering environments to reflect the uncertainty of predicting future environments?
    + Can we used long-term weather information and soil data?
    + Crop simulations?

### Objectives

##### What is the impact on prediction accuracy of different methods of measuring the relationship between environments or clustering environments?

1. 







1. Understand the contribution of GxE to a highly balanced genomewide selection program
    + Use previously described methods (without ECs)
2. Test methods of predicting unobserved genotypes in unobserved environments
    + Use checks to describe correlation between environments (beach-head method)
    + Cluster environments using ECs (short-term)
    + Cluster locations into regions using ECs (long-term)

### To Do

~~1. Estimate heritability within each environment and overall~~
2. Estimate variance components for $V_G$, $V_GE$ and $V_R$
3. Compute the variance-covariance matrix across environments
    + Use TP
    + Use checks
    + Use environmental covariates
4. Develop a method to cluster environments based on ECs
5. Develop a method to cluster locations into MEs based on long-term ECs
6. Test methods of prediction
